"""Auto-apply the downstream_compat marker to every test in this directory.

These tests verify that tinker-cookbook's public API surface remains compatible
with downstream consumers. They are fast, require
no API keys or GPU, and run on every PR.

Run just these tests:
    uv run pytest tests/downstream_compat/
    uv run pytest -m downstream_compat
