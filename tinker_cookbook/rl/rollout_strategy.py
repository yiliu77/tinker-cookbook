"""Pluggable strategies for collecting trajectories within a rollout group.

A :class:`RolloutStrategy` decides *how* to run N single-rollout coroutines
in parallel — whether to fail fast, retry on failure, etc.  It owns the full
trajectory collection lifecycle including env creation (via
``EnvGroupBuilder.make_envs()``), so strategies like retry can create fresh
envs as needed.

Group reward computation and logging remain in
:func:`~tinker_cookbook.rl.rollouts.do_group_rollout`.

Implementations must be pickleable (frozen dataclasses with primitive fields)
because they are bundled into ``_RolloutTask`` for cross-process dispatch.

class MinViableGroup(RolloutStrategy):
    """Accept a partial group once a minimum number of rollouts succeed.

    Runs all rollouts concurrently and retries failures (with fresh
    environments) while the retry budget lasts and the floor has not yet been
    met.  Once at least ``min_successful`` trajectories have completed, the
    group is returned as-is — possibly smaller than requested, with the
    failures recorded in ``RolloutResult.errors``.  If the floor is still
    unmet after all rollouts and retries have finished,
    :class:`~tinker_cookbook.exceptions.AllTrajectoriesFailedError` is raised
    and the whole group is dropped (the same group-drop path used when every
    trajectory fails).

    **Why a floor instead of all-or-nothing or anything-goes?**
    Group-relative advantage estimation
    (:func:`~tinker_cookbook.rl.data_processing.compute_advantages`) centers
    each trajectory's reward against the *group mean*: the group is the
    baseline.  The mean of ``G`` rewards is an estimate whose variance scales
    as ``1/G``, so as failures shrink the group, the baseline estimate gets
    noisier and every advantage in the group degrades with it (an advantage
    is ``reward - baseline``, so baseline noise lands on every member).
    Below some floor, the salvaged group contributes more variance than
    signal — at that point it is better to drop the group entirely than to
    train on noise.  The floor bounds how degraded a baseline we are willing
    to train against, while still salvaging groups that lost only a few
    members (unlike :class:`RetryOnFailure`, which drops the whole group once
    its retry budget is exhausted).

    **Partial groups change the centering denominator.**  A 13-member group
    centers against the mean of 13 rewards where a full group would have
    centered against 16.  This is expected and handled:
    ``compute_advantages`` computes ``rewards_G - rewards_G.mean()`` over
    whatever ``G`` the group actually contains, normalizing by the actual
    group size — there is no hardcoded assumption of the requested size
    anywhere downstream.  The consequence is statistical, not mechanical:
    the smaller ``G`` is, the noisier the baseline (see above).

    **Interaction with constant-reward filtering.**  Downstream,
    ``do_group_rollout_and_filter_constant_reward`` drops groups whose
    surviving trajectories all share one reward value (no gradient signal).
    A salvaged partial group whose survivors happen to agree — e.g. the
    diverse members were exactly the ones that failed — still gets filtered,
    so effective sample size can shrink twice: once from failures (bounded by
    this floor) and once from the constant-reward filter (not bounded by it).
    The floor guarantees a minimum group size *entering* that filter, not a
    minimum surviving it.

    Args:
        min_successful: The floor — the minimum number of successful
            trajectories required to keep the group.  ``None`` (default)
            computes ``ceil(0.75 * group_size)`` at call time, where
            ``group_size`` is the number of environments the builder created.
        max_retries: Total retry budget across all trajectories in the group
            (same semantics as :class:`RetryOnFailure`).  Retries are only
            spent while the floor is unmet; once enough trajectories have
            succeeded, further failures are recorded but not retried.
        per_rollout_timeout: Maximum seconds for a single rollout before it
            is cancelled and treated as a failure.  ``None`` (default)
            disables the timeout.
