"""Basic interfaces and types for reinforcement learning.

This module defines the core abstractions for RL training in Tinker:

- **Env** and **EnvGroupBuilder**: the environment protocol that users implement.
- **Trajectory**, **Transition**, **TrajectoryGroup**: data containers that flow
  through the rollout and training pipeline.
- **RLDataset** and **RLDatasetBuilder**: dataset interfaces consumed by training
  loops.

Type aliases
------------
- ``Action`` – ``list[int]`` of token IDs produced by the agent.
- ``Observation`` – ``tinker.ModelInput`` fed to the model.
- ``Logprobs`` – ``list[float]`` of per-token log-probabilities.
- ``Metrics`` – ``dict[str, float | int]`` of numeric values aggregated in logs.
- ``Logs`` – ``dict[str, str | int | float]`` of diagnostic info for display.

    Builds a group of environments. The group will be used in the following way:

    - The reward function (compute_group_rewards) has access to the trajectories from the
      whole group, even though many reward functions will evaluate each one independently.

      - For example, this enables us to use pairwise reward models that look at a pair of
        trajectories at a time. With such a reward model, we effectively have a multi-agent
        environment, where the agents are playing a zero-sum game.

    Groups can be used in two ways, in practice:

    - To define a multi-agent environment
    - As a part of the *algorithm* (e.g. GRPO), when dealing with single-agent tasks.

    **Picklability:** Implementations must be pickleable (via standard ``pickle``) to support
    distributed rollout execution where builders are serialized and sent to remote workers.
    Avoid storing live network connections, file handles, or other unpickleable objects as
    fields. Use ``get_renderer()`` to create Renderers (which are automatically pickle-safe).
    Store configuration strings (model names, connection params) and construct heavy objects
