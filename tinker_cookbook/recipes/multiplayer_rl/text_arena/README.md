# Learning Tic-Tac-Toe via Self-Play

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install 'tinker-cookbook[multiplayer-rl] @ git+https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker-cookbook.git@nightly'
```

Many research studies involve training several different language model agents jointly. We cover one simple example, where the language model learns to play tic-tac-toe with itself.
We show how to coordinate the steps of two *Environment* objects such that both the winning and the losing trajectory will be used to fine-tune the weights.

## Training

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.multiplayer_rl.text_arena.train
```

With the default settings (batch size 512, ~40k datapoints = 80 steps), training takes roughly 1-2 hours.

### Expected results

The key metric to watch is `test/env/all/reward/total`, which measures how well the trained policy performs against the (untrained) base model.

| Step | Train reward (self-play) | Test reward (vs base model) |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 0    | ~ -0.4                   | ~ -0.4                      |
| 5    | ~ 0.0                    | ~ +0.3                      |
| 20   | ~ 0.0                    | ~ +0.2                      |
| 40   | ~ 0.0                    | ~ +0.5 to +0.7              |
| 60   | ~ 0.0                    | ~ +0.4 to +0.6              |

**Why is a self-play reward of 0 good?** In tic-tac-toe, optimal play by both sides always results in a draw. The self-play training reward converging to 0 means both the "Player 0" and "Player 1" copies of the model have learned to play without making mistakes -- neither side can win. The test reward (vs the untrained base model) rises from negative to positive, meaning the trained model dominates the base model.

### Self-play dynamics over 256 steps

Running for the full 256 steps reveals interesting training dynamics:

| Phase | Steps | Self-play reward | Test reward | Description |
|-------|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Learning | 0-5 | -0.4 → 0.0 | -0.4 → +0.3 | Model learns basic play |
| Plateau | 5-75 | ~0.0 | +0.3 to +0.7 | Stable, strong play |
| Collapse | 80-110 | **-1.0** | +0.4 → -0.1 | One side wins every game |
| Recovery | 115-130 | 0.0 | -0.2 → +0.6 | Brief recovery |
| Degradation | 135-256 | 0.0 | -0.1 to -0.25 | Degenerate equilibrium |

The **collapse** at step 80 happens because a small asymmetry gets amplified — if one side becomes slightly stronger, the training update reinforces that advantage, creating a feedback loop that destabilizes within a few steps.

The model **recovers** around step 115, but then settles into a **degenerate equilibrium**: both sides draw in self-play (reward ≈ 0), but the strategy is actually worse than the base model (test reward goes negative). The collapse breaks the learned strategy, and the recovery converges to a different, weaker fixed point. This is a known challenge with self-play RL.

> **Note:** the reward tables above were measured on the now-retired `Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`. A 25-step verification run with `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` reproduced the early-phase shape (invalid moves eliminated within ~10 steps, test reward positive by step 5), but the full 256-step dynamics have not been re-measured.

The default of 80 steps avoids the collapse while capturing the performance plateau. Potential mitigations for longer training runs include mixing self-play with games against a fixed opponent (random or base model) in each batch, or periodically freezing a copy of the weights to play against.

### CLI options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `model_name` | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` | Starting checkpoint to fine-tune (uses `qwen3_5_disable_thinking` renderer) |
| `batch_size` | `512` | Trajectories per training step |
| `num_train_datapoints` | `40960` | Total training trajectories (~80 steps) |
| `learning_rate` | `3e-5` | Adam learning rate |
| `eval_every` | `5` | Evaluate every N steps |
| `save_every` | `20` | Checkpoint every N steps |
| `test_opponent` | `base_model` | Test opponent: `base_model`, `random`, or `optimal` |
| `max_steps` | `None` | Cap training steps (None = use all data) |

## Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model against different opponents:

```bash
# Evaluate against the optimal (minimax) opponent — perfect play always draws:
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.multiplayer_rl.text_arena.play \
    checkpoint_path=<path> mode=eval opponent=optimal num_games=20

# Evaluate against a random opponent:
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.multiplayer_rl.text_arena.play \
    checkpoint_path=<path> mode=eval opponent=random num_games=20

# Evaluate against the (untrained) base model:
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.multiplayer_rl.text_arena.play \
    checkpoint_path=<path> mode=eval opponent=base_model num_games=20
```

Results before and after training (20 games each, model plays as Player 0):

| Opponent | Base model (step 0) | Trained (step 40) |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| vs Random | 4W / 10D / 6L | 6W / 11D / 3L |
| vs Optimal (minimax) | 0W / 0D / **20L** | 0W / **20D** / 0L |
| vs Base model | — | 16W / 4D / 0L |

The untrained base model loses every game against the optimal minimax opponent and frequently loses to random. After 40 steps of self-play training, the model draws every game against optimal — confirming it learned perfect tic-tac-toe. The improvement is most dramatic against optimal: from 0% survival to 100% draws.

## Interactive play

You can also play against the trained model interactively (requires a real terminal):

```bash
# Play against the model (you go first as Player 0):
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.multiplayer_rl.text_arena.play \
    checkpoint_path=<path>

# Play as Player 1 (model goes first):
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.multiplayer_rl.text_arena.play \
    checkpoint_path=<path> human_player_id=1
```

## Background

### TextArena

The TextArena [1] already implements an environment object where two players can specify which position to play using ``[0], [1], [2] ...`` in tic-tac-toe and compute how the board changes, the observation (prompt) for each language model player, and the final reward.

Here's an example language model input:
```
[GAME] You are Player 0 in Tic Tac Toe.
Your goal is to win three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on the board.
On your turn, you should select the square number (0-8) you want to put your mark in next.
For example, '[4]' places your mark in the center cell of the board.

As Player 0, you will be 'O', while your opponent is 'X'.

[GAME] Current Board:

 0 | 1 | 2
---+---+---
 3 | 4 | 5
---+---+---
 6 | 7 | 8

Available Moves: '[0]', '[1]', '[2]', '[3]', '[4]', '[5]', '[6]', '[7]', '[8]'
```

If the language model wants to play in the middle, it can output `[4]`.

### Coordinators

Training an LLM to play against a fixed LLM is straightforward -- this is quite similar to our twenty-question example, where we sample the response from another LLM in the `Env.step` function.
However, in this example, we want to train on both trajectories where the language model plays on each side.
Therefore, in the `Env.step` function, we need to receive the opponent's action, which is generated in another trajectory in another `Environment` object.
This motivates the design of the `Coordinator` class, which passes the LLM-generated text between two `Environment` objects and synchronizes the two `Environment` objects to alternate taking steps.

In our implementation, the `TwoPlayerCoordinator` object is shared across two `Environment` objects, and it:

- wraps the tic-tac-toe environment from the TextArena [1],
- waits for a specific player's turn to begin, and
- allows one player to `make_move` on the board, and notifies the other player that the move is complete.

As a result, in the `Environment.step` function, we can:

- determine when to start the next move, since `TwoPlayerCoordinator` informs us when the opponent has finished.
- compute the next observation, since `TwoPlayerCoordinator` passes the move from the opponent.

### Opponent modes

The recipe supports different opponent types for evaluation:

- **`random`**: Picks a random legal move each turn. A well-trained model should rarely lose. No API calls needed.
- **`optimal`**: Perfect minimax player. Optimal vs optimal always draws, so a model that consistently draws has learned perfect play. No API calls needed.
- **`base_model`** (default for training eval): The trained model plays against the untrained base model. Measures improvement relative to the starting weights. Requires a second Tinker sampling session.

### Extensions

Multi-agent training is a very active research direction with many different algorithm choices, e.g., debate [2], prover-verifier games [3], etc.
We hope Tinker can support the broader research community to explore these opportunities!
