# Distillation

Distillation refers to a class of methods where a teacher model is supervising the training of a student model, which can often be more efficient than training the student model in isolation. We provide off-policy and on-policy distillation recipes on top of the [OpenThoughts3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-thoughts/OpenThoughts3-1.2M), [DeepMath](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zwhe99/DeepMath-103K), and [Tulu3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture)* datasets.

Specifically, we provide the scripts needed to reproduce our experiments from the [On-Policy Distillation](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/on-policy-distillation) blog post, which can be run with LoRA using Tinker.

\* For our post, we regenerated the assistant turns using [Qwen3-8B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B).

## Distillation for reasoning

Our results can be reproduced by running:

1. Supervised fine-tuning on [OpenThoughts3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-thoughts/OpenThoughts3-1.2M)
2. On-policy distillation on [DeepMath](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zwhe99/DeepMath-103K)

### Supervised fine-tuning

We observe an AIME'24 score of ~65% using a rank-128 LoRA after 3000 steps. We use a learning rate of 1e-3 with LoRA and 1e-4 with full fine-tuning.

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.distillation.off_policy_reasoning \
    model_name=Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B-Base \
    learning_rate=1e-3 \
    batch_size=128 \
    lora_rank=128 \
    wandb_project=cookbook_distillation
```

### On-policy distillation

We observe an AIME'24 score of ~76.7% using a rank-128 LoRA after 200 steps with 16k-token rollouts. For on-policy distillation experiments, we use a learning rate of 1e-4 with LoRA and 5e-5 with full fine-tuning.

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.distillation.on_policy_distillation \
    model_name=Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B-Base \
    teacher_model=Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B \
    load_checkpoint_path=tinker://b89f6676-49c4-53ed-9788-2e0c81a9eabf:train:0/weights/final \
    dataset=deepmath \
    learning_rate=1e-4 \
    groups_per_batch=512 \
    lora_rank=128 \
    max_tokens=16384 \
    wandb_project=cookbook_distillation
```

This script can also be used to replicate the experiments in our Discussion section, after you have run RL to obtain an appropriate checkpoint for the teacher model.

The AIME'24 scores above were evaluated with `temperature=1.0`, `top_p=1.0`, `top_k=-1`, and `max_tokens=64000`.

### Checkpoints

The results of running the above scripts with various LoRA ranks can be found here:

| Stage | Rank 8 | Rank 32 | Rank 128 |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) | `tinker://414d30d0-3b63-5596-919d-647960d156c2:train:0/weights/final` | `tinker://1a32513a-6177-5642-bebd-ecc8e255d4a7:train:0/weights/final` | `tinker://b89f6676-49c4-53ed-9788-2e0c81a9eabf:train:0/weights/final` |
| On-policy distillation | `tinker://52f1ee62-da13-547e-a3c0-708d7a680bb0:train:0/sampler_weights/final` | `tinker://00a05e59-9fc3-5f99-ba72-f28ca69c9894:train:0/sampler_weights/final` | `tinker://de58946a-6bfd-5ab2-821f-03b61d237b5b:train:0/sampler_weights/final` |

See the on-policy distillation launch command above for an example of how to load the checkpoint path.

## Distillation for personalization

In this section, we ran:

1. Supervised fine-tuning on internal documents + resampled Tulu3 data
2. On-policy distillation on [Tulu3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/tulu-3-sft-mixture) prompts

### On-policy distillation

In our experiment, we saw [IF-eval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google/IFEval) recover within approximately 100 steps; we expect similar results in other settings. In order to use this script, you will have to provide your own SFT initialization.

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.distillation.on_policy_distillation \
    model_name=Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B-Base \
    teacher_model=Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B \
    load_checkpoint_path=tinker://YOUR_SFT_INITIALIZATION \
    dataset=tulu3 \
    learning_rate=1e-4 \
    groups_per_batch=64 \
    lora_rank=128 \
    wandb_project=cookbook_distillation
```

## Distillation for multi-turn tool use

The recipes above are single-turn — the student generates one response per prompt and receives a KL signal against the teacher. This works for reasoning and chat, but tool-use tasks require multi-turn interaction: the agent calls tools, observes results, and iterates. This recipe extends on-policy distillation to multi-turn tool-use episodes using Harbor sandbox environments.

### Architecture

Multi-turn distillation reuses three layers of infrastructure:

1. **`tool_use` library** (`tinker_cookbook/tool_use/`) — Generic agent-tool interaction. `@tool` decorator defines tools, `build_agent_tool_env()` creates token-level RL environments from tools + renderer + reward function. `AgentToolMessageEnv` manages the message-level episode loop (append assistant message → execute tool calls → check termination).

2. **`harbor_rl` recipe** (`tinker_cookbook/recipes/harbor_rl/`) — Applies `tool_use` to Harbor sandbox tasks. `HarborBashTool` wraps a sandbox as a `@tool`-decorated bash command. `HarborEnvGroupBuilder` creates sandboxed environments with task-specific grading via `HarborReward`.

3. **Multi-turn distillation** (`tinker_cookbook/recipes/distillation/harbor_multiturn.py`) — `HarborDistillationDatasetBuilder` subclasses `HarborDatasetBuilder`, passing `reward_fn=zero_reward` (always returns 0.0) to override the default `HarborReward`. The only training signal is KL divergence against the teacher.

Environment-provided tokens (system prompt, user message, tool responses, assistant headers) are masked out during training — only the student's generated tokens contribute to the loss.

### Data setup

This recipe uses Harbor sandbox tasks. To get started:

- **Download:** `uvx harbor datasets download terminal-bench@2.0` (lands in `~/.cache/harbor/tasks/`)
- **Load:** `load_terminal_bench_tasks()` from `tinker_cookbook.recipes.harbor_rl.launch_terminal_bench`
- **Custom tasks:** any `HarborTask` with `environment/Dockerfile` and `tests/test.sh`

See `tinker_cookbook/recipes/harbor_rl/README.md` for full details on the HarborTask format and sandbox protocol.

### On-policy distillation (Harbor)

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.distillation.on_policy_distillation_harbor_multi_turn \
    model_name=moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6 \
    teacher_model=moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6 \
    max_turns=10 \
    group_size=4 \
    groups_per_batch=8 \
    learning_rate=1e-4 \
    lora_rank=8 \
    max_tokens=2048 \
    max_trajectory_tokens=24576 \
    temperature=1.0 \
    kl_penalty_coef=1.0 \
    sandbox_timeout=600 \
    command_timeout=120 \
    save_every=5 \
    eval_every=5 \
    wandb_name=cookbook-multiturn-onpodi
```

## Additional details

### Reward calculation

In on-policy distillation, we use an `Environment` that has no rewards (neither correctness nor format). The only supervision comes from minimizing the KL against a teacher model. You can optionally increase `kl_discount_factor` to optimize discounted future KL, but we generally do not observe this to improve performance.

### Distillation with multiple teachers

For every dataset, we can define a teacher model and batch size (`groups_per_batch`) to use:

```python
{
    "dataset_builder": RLDatasetBuilder,
    "teacher_model": {
        "base_model": str,  # e.g. "Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B"
        "load_checkpoint_path": str | None  # e.g. "tinker://<unique_id>/sampler_weights/final
    },
    "groups_per_batch": int
}
```

The trainer will then sample from each configuration, and concatenate all the individual dataset batches to form the batch for training. This can be used to run multi-teacher distillation, although we do not showcase this in our blog post.

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.distillation.on_policy_multi_teacher \
    model_name=Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B \
    learning_rate=1e-4 \
    deepmath_groups_per_batch=256 \
    tulu3_groups_per_batch=256 \
    lora_rank=128 \
    wandb_project=cookbook_distillation
```
