# RLHF Pipeline

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.preference.rlhf.rlhf_pipeline
```

There are three stages:

1. Policy SFT stage: this stage is short, and `test/nll` should decrease from 1.87 to 1.63 in 20 steps.
2. Reward model SFT stage: this stage is longer, and `test/nll` should drastically decrease from 3.0 to around 0.58 in the first 40 steps, slowly decrease to 0.54 at around step 300, and converge to around 0.53 in 600 steps. This stage needs to finish before the next stage.
3. Policy RL stage: `test/win_rate` should increase from ~46% to ~94% in 100 steps.

### Stage 1 and 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning

The first two stages are supervised fine-tuning, which is relatively straightforward (see `recipes.sl_basic` for an example). In the first stage, we perform supervised fine-tuning to initialize the policy on the `no_robots` dataset from Hugging Face; in the second stage, we perform supervised fine-tuning to learn the reward model on the `HHH` dataset from Anthropic.

### Stage 3: RL against the Reward Model

In the third stage, we initialize with the policy produced by the first stage, and optimize against the reward model learned in the second stage.
As before, we need to implement a `PreferenceModelBuilder` and a `ComparisonBuilder`.
In our implementation, we use `PreferenceModelBuilderFromChatRenderer` for the former, and `HHHComparisonBuilder` for the latter.
Now we can optimize against a learned reward model!

### Next

We include another way to learn from preferences, DPO, which requires a custom loss function.
