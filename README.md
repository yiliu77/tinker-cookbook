We provide two libraries for the broader community to customize their language models: `tinker` and `tinker-cookbook`.

- `tinker` is a training SDK for researchers and developers to fine-tune language models. You send API requests to us and we handle the complexities of distributed training.
- `tinker-cookbook` includes realistic examples of fine-tuning language models. It builds on the Tinker API and provides common abstractions to fine-tune language models.

## Installation

1. Sign up for Tinker [here](https://auth.thinkingmachines.ai/sign-up).
2. Once you have access, create an API key from the [console](https://tinker-console.thinkingmachines.ai) and export it as environment variable `TINKER_API_KEY`.
3. Install `tinker-cookbook` (includes the `tinker` SDK as a dependency):
   ```bash
   # Latest stable release from PyPI
   uv pip install tinker-cookbook

   # Or install the nightly build
   uv pip install 'tinker-cookbook @ git+https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker-cookbook.git@nightly'
   ```

## Using Inkling

Inkling is Thinking Machines Lab's model tailored for Tinker. It is a
general-purpose model that can code, reason, call tools, and process image and
audio inputs. Tinker Cookbook supports sampling and post-training Inkling
through the standalone `tml-renderers` library; install it with the `inkling`
extra, which also pulls in the required `torch>=2.10`:

```bash
uv pip install 'tinker-cookbook[inkling]'
```

Pass `model_name="thinkingmachines/Inkling"` anywhere the cookbook accepts a
model name. The appropriate renderer and tokenizer are selected automatically.

Inkling supports [controllable reasoning effort](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/cookbook/inkling/thinking-effort/)
and multimodal [audio](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/cookbook/inkling/audio/)
and [image](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/cookbook/inkling/images/)
inputs. See the [Inkling documentation](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/cookbook/inkling/)
for setup and usage details.

## Tinker

Here we introduce a few Tinker primitives — the basic components to fine-tune LLMs (see the [quickstart guide](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/quickstart/) for more details):

```python
import tinker
service_client = tinker.ServiceClient()
training_client = service_client.create_lora_training_client(
  base_model="meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B", rank=32,
)
training_client.forward_backward(...)
training_client.optim_step(...)
training_client.save_state(...)
training_client.load_state(...)

sampling_client = training_client.save_weights_and_get_sampling_client()
sampling_client.sample(...)
```

See [tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_loop.py](tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_loop.py) and [tinker_cookbook/recipes/rl_loop.py](tinker_cookbook/recipes/rl_loop.py) for minimal examples of using these primitives to fine-tune LLMs.

### Tutorials

New to Tinker? The [`tutorials/`](tutorials/) directory contains 20+ progressive [marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks that walk through core concepts — rendering, loss functions, completers, weight management — and advanced topics such as custom RL environments, DPO, RLHF, and weight export. Run any tutorial with `marimo edit tutorials/101_hello_tinker.py`. See the [tutorials README](tutorials/README.md) for the full list, or browse rendered versions on the [Tinker docs site](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/tutorials).

To download the weights of any model:
```python
rest_client = service_client.create_rest_client()
future = rest_client.get_checkpoint_archive_url_from_tinker_path(sampling_client.model_path)
with open(f"model-checkpoint.tar.gz", "wb") as f:
    f.write(future.result())
```

### Tinker Cookbook

Besides these primitives, we also offer **Tinker Cookbook** (a.k.a. this repo), a library of a wide range of abstractions to help you customize training environments.
[`tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_basic.py`](tinker_cookbook/recipes/sl_basic.py) and [`tinker_cookbook/recipes/rl_basic.py`](tinker_cookbook/recipes/rl_basic.py) contain minimal examples to configure supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

We also include more complete examples in the [`tinker_cookbook/recipes/`](tinker_cookbook/recipes/) folder:
- **[Chat SFT](tinker_cookbook/recipes/chat_sl/)**: supervised fine-tuning on conversational datasets (e.g., Tulu3).
- **[Math RL](tinker_cookbook/recipes/math_rl/)**: reinforcement learning for mathematical reasoning with verifiable rewards.
- **[Code RL](tinker_cookbook/recipes/code_rl/)**: RL on competitive programming with sandboxed code execution (DeepCoder replication).
- **[Preference learning](tinker_cookbook/recipes/preference/)**: DPO and a three-stage RLHF pipeline (SFT, reward model, RL).
- **[Distillation](tinker_cookbook/recipes/distillation/)**: on-policy and off-policy knowledge distillation with single- and multi-teacher configurations.
- **[Tool use](tinker_cookbook/recipes/search_tool/)**: RL for retrieval-augmented generation (Search-R1 replication).
- **[Multi-agent](tinker_cookbook/recipes/multiplayer_rl/)**: multi-agent RL with self-play and cross-play.
- **[Audio](tinker_cookbook/recipes/audio/)**: SFT and RL for Inkling audio inputs, including speech recognition and speaking-style classification.
- **[VLM image classification](tinker_cookbook/recipes/vlm_classifier/)**: supervised training and evaluation for vision-language models.

The [recipes README](tinker_cookbook/recipes/README.md) covers all available recipes, including Harbor RL, rubric-based grading, VLM classification, and SDFT. Each recipe includes a `README.md` with implementation details, launch commands, and expected results.

### Evaluation (experimental)

Tinker Cookbook includes a [benchmark framework](tinker_cookbook/eval/) for evaluating trained models:

```python
from tinker_cookbook.eval.benchmarks import run_benchmarks, BenchmarkConfig

results = await run_benchmarks(
    ["gsm8k", "mmlu_pro", "ifeval"],
    sampling_client, renderer,
    BenchmarkConfig(save_dir="evals/step500"),
)
```

The framework currently supports 12 benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MMLU-Pro, MMLU-Redux, GPQA, IFEval, MBPP, C-Eval, SuperGPQA, IFBench, AIME 2025, AIME 2026) with verified scores against published results, plus experimental benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench, Terminal Bench, and SWE-bench. Benchmarks can also serve as inline training evaluators via `BenchmarkEvaluator`.

**Note:** Benchmark scores are sensitive to evaluation configuration — system prompts, `max_tokens`, temperature, and timeout settings can shift results significantly. We document our exact settings alongside all reported scores. This framework is under active development; feedback and contributions are welcome. See the [eval README](tinker_cookbook/eval/README.md) for verified scores, configuration details, and instructions for adding new benchmarks.

For the full Tinker documentation, visit [tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai).

### Utilities

Tinker Cookbook also provides reusable building blocks:
- [`renderers`](tinker_cookbook/renderers/) — bidirectional conversion between token sequences and structured chat messages
- [`hyperparam_utils`](tinker_cookbook/hyperparam_utils.py) — learning rate and hyperparameter scaling for LoRA training
- [`eval`](tinker_cookbook/eval/) — benchmark framework and inline training evaluators (see [Evaluation](#evaluation-experimental) above)

## Claude Code Skills

Tinker Cookbook ships with [Claude Code skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that teach Claude how to use the Tinker API. Install them so Claude can help you write training code in any project:

```
/plugin marketplace add thinking-machines-lab/tinker-cookbook
```

Then install the **tinker** plugin from the Discover tab (`/plugin` → Discover). Once installed, two skills are available:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/tinker:research` | Plan and run post-training experiments — SFT, RL, DPO, distillation, evaluation, hyperparameters, model selection, and more |
| `/tinker:debug` | Diagnose slow training, hangs, output mismatches, renderer issues, and errors |

Skills also trigger automatically based on context — ask Claude to "set up SFT training" and it will load the right skill without a slash command. Skills update automatically when the repo is updated.

## Development Setup

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
pre-commit install
```

This installs dev dependencies and registers pre-commit hooks that run `ruff` formatting and linting on every commit. CI enforces these checks on all pull requests.
